# Breakout Game

This is my version of the classic Atari game Breakout, recreated using Python and Turtle Graphics.

## How to Play

- Use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to move the paddle.
- Press the space bar to release the ball at the beginning of the game or after losing a life.
- Use the paddle and ball to clear bricks from the screen without losing all your lives.
- Earn points by breaking bricks. Each colored brick has a different point value.
- The ball speed increases after breaking 4 bricks, 8 bricks, the first collision with the orange brick, and the first collision with a red brick.
- The paddle will shrink to half its size when the ball hits the top wall.
- You have three lives to complete the objective. You will lose a life each time the ball passes the paddle.
- Have fun!
